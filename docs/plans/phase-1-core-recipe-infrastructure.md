---

## Risk Assessment

### ðŸ”´ High Risk
- **Image upload complexity**: File handling, validation, and storage
- **Form state management**: Complex nested forms with dynamic fields
- **Search performance**: Large recipe databases may need optimization

### ðŸŸ¡ Medium Risk  
- **Database query optimization**: May need tuning for complex filters
- **Mobile form UX**: Recipe forms can be complex on small screens

### ðŸŸ¢ Low Risk
- **Basic CRUD operations**: Well-established patterns
- **Component structure**: Clear separation of concerns

---

## Performance Considerations

### Database Performance
- Use pagination for recipe lists (20-50 recipes per page)
- Implement lazy loading for recipe components
- Cache common queries (user's recent recipes)

### Image Performance
- Compress uploaded images automatically
- Generate thumbnails for recipe cards
- Use Next.js Image component for optimization

### UI Performance
- Implement virtual scrolling for large recipe lists
- Use React.memo for expensive recipe components
- Debounce search inputs to reduce API calls

---

## Future Integration Points

This phase establishes foundations for:
- **Phase 2**: Recipe collections and enhanced tagging
- **Phase 3**: AI-powered features (recipe suggestions, nutritional analysis)
- **Phase 4**: Meal planning and shopping lists
- **Phase 5**: Import/export and sharing features
