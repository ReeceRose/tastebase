## Overview

Implement an AI-powered chat interface that transforms recipe management from static forms into dynamic conversations. Users can discover recipes through natural language ("What can I make with chicken and rice?"), get real-time cooking assistance, and interactively create or modify recipes through conversational AI.

## Goals

- ✅ Interactive recipe discovery through natural language queries
- ✅ Conversational recipe creation with AI guidance
- ✅ Real-time cooking assistance and substitution suggestions
- ✅ Natural language recipe modification and scaling
- ✅ Multi-turn conversations with context awareness
- ✅ Seamless integration with existing recipe CRUD operations
- ✅ Chat history and session management

```typescript
// Extends Phase 3's AI task system
export type ChatTask = 
  | 'chat-conversation'
  | 'recipe-discovery' 
  | 'cooking-assistance'
  | 'recipe-modification';

// Uses Phase 3's flexible response system
export type ChatResponse = {
  type: 'conversational';
  text: string;
  actions?: RecipeAction[];
  suggestions?: string[];
  context?: ConversationContext;
};
```

**Real-Time Communication:**
```typescript
// WebSocket/SSE integration
export interface ChatMessage {
  id: string;
  role: 'user' | 'assistant';

  actions?: RecipeAction[];
  metadata?: MessageMetadata;
}

export interface ConversationContext {
  currentRecipes?: Recipe[];
  ingredients?: string[];
  cookingState?: 'planning' | 'active' | 'finished';

- **Response quality**: Chat responses may be less structured and useful than form-based recipe entry
- **Performance impact**: Real-time chat may strain AI provider costs and response times
- **User confusion**: Chat interface may confuse users expecting traditional recipe management

### 🟡 Medium Risk
- **Feature scope**: Chat features may expand beyond core recipe management use cases
- **Integration complexity**: Seamless integration with existing recipe workflows may require significant refactoring
- **Context management**: Conversation state persistence across sessions may be unreliable
- **Mobile experience**: Chat interface may not work well on small screens or touch devices

### 🟢 Low Risk
- **Technical foundation**: Phase 3's extensible architecture provides solid foundation for chat features
- **User adoption**: Optional chat interface allows gradual user adoption alongside existing features
- **Provider flexibility**: Multi-provider AI system provides fallback options for chat functionality
