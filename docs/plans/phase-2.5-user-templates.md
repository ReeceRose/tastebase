# Phase 2.5: User Templates & Personalization

**Duration:** 3-4 days  
**Priority:** High (User Experience Enhancement)  
**Prerequisites:** Phase 2 (Recipe CRUD) completed  
**Dependencies:** Foundation for Phase 3 (AI Integration) template enhancements  

---

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive user template system that allows users to create, manage, and use custom note templates for recipe notes. This phase bridges the gap between basic recipe management and advanced AI features by providing personalized note-taking capabilities that can later be enhanced with AI suggestions and generation.

## Goals

- âœ… Enable users to create custom note templates with categories and tags
- âœ… Provide comprehensive template management interface (CRUD operations)
- âœ… Integrate user templates seamlessly with existing note creation flow
- âœ… Support template usage tracking and analytics
- âœ… Implement hybrid system combining system and user templates
- âœ… Establish foundation for future AI-enhanced template features

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema
```sql
-- User note templates table
CREATE TABLE user_note_templates (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  category TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'general',
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  tags JSON, -- Array of strings
  is_public BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false,
  usage_count INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Server Actions Architecture
- Authentication required for all operations
- User ownership verification on every request
- Comprehensive input validation with Zod schemas
- Structured logging for debugging and analytics
- Error handling with user-friendly messages

### UI Component Organization
```
src/components/
â”œâ”€â”€ forms/template-form.tsx          # Template creation/editing
â”œâ”€â”€ lists/template-list.tsx          # Management interface
â”œâ”€â”€ cards/template-card.tsx          # Individual template display
