# Phase 0: Foundation & Cleanup

**Duration:** 3-4 days  
**Priority:** Critical (Must complete before Phase 1)  
**Prerequisites:** None  
**Dependencies:** Sets foundation for all subsequent phases

---

## Overview

This phase focuses on cleaning up the inherited SaaS template and establishing the proper foundation for a recipe management application. We need to remove unnecessary features, refactor existing code to match project standards, and set up the correct infrastructure.

## Current State Analysis

### ‚úÖ Already Working
- Next.js 15+ with App Router and Server Actions
- BetterAuth integration (needs refactoring)
- Drizzle ORM with SQLite/libSQL
- ShadCN/UI components
- Tailwind CSS
- Pino logging system
- Feature-based architecture structure
- Comprehensive development scripts

### ‚ùå Needs Removal/Refactoring
- Clerk references in documentation and comments
- Stripe billing and subscription features
- Organization/team management features
- Payment-related components and logic
- SaaS-specific database schema elements
- Multi-tenant architecture patterns
- Billing-related API routes and webhooks

### üîß Needs Refactoring
- Recipe schema currently in schema.base.ts (should be modular)
- BetterAuth configuration (not optimized for single-user)
- Environment variables setup
- Database configuration for proper local development
- Docker setup for deployment

---

## Risk Assessment

### üî¥ High Risk
- **Database migration issues:** Ensure proper backup and migration testing
- **Authentication breaks:** Test all auth flows thoroughly after refactoring
- **Missing dependencies:** Verify no critical code depends on removed features

### üü° Medium Risk  
- **Build process changes:** Docker and deployment changes may need debugging
- **Environment variable misconfigurations:** Test all environment setups

### üü¢ Low Risk
- **UI component cleanup:** Mostly isolated changes
- **Documentation updates:** Non-breaking changes

---

## Migration Notes

### Database Migration Strategy
1. Create new recipe schema files
2. Generate migration for new structure
3. Test migration with sample data
4. Remove old schema elements
5. Clean up unused tables and columns

### Code Migration Strategy  
1. Remove features in order of dependencies (billing ‚Üí organizations ‚Üí auth cleanup)
2. Update imports and references as you go
3. Test after each major removal
4. Update documentation continuously

### Testing Strategy
1. Run health checks after each major change
2. Test authentication flows frequently
3. Verify database operations work
4. Test Docker setup early and often
