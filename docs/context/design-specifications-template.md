# UX/UI Design Specifications - [Directory] - [Timestamp]

> **Template for UX-UI Designer Agent Output**
> This file should be created by the UX-UI Designer agent during Phase 1 of the ux-refactor command.
> Replace [Directory] and [Timestamp] with actual values.

## Executive Summary

Brief overview of the refactoring scope, key improvements, and expected outcomes.

## Current State Analysis

### Component Inventory
- List all React component files found in the directory
- Current file sizes and complexity assessment
- Existing dependencies and imports

### UX/UI Issues Identified
- Poor mobile responsiveness
- Lack of loading states
- Inconsistent component structure
- Accessibility violations
- Performance bottlenecks
- Custom UI instead of ShadCN components

### Improvement Opportunities
- Specific areas where UX can be enhanced
- Components that need modularization
- Missing skeleton loading states
- Server action extraction opportunities

## Refactoring Plan

### Component Breakdown Strategy
For each component file:
```markdown
#### ComponentName.tsx
- **Current Issues**: [List specific problems]
- **Proposed Split**: [How to break into smaller components]
- **New Structure**: [File organization plan]
- **Dependencies**: [What this component depends on]
```

### ShadCN Integration Requirements
- List of ShadCN components needed
- Commands to install missing components: `npx shadcn@latest add <component>`
- Color migration plan from hardcoded colors to semantic variables
- Specific component mappings (custom button â†’ ShadCN Button, etc.)

### Mobile-First Responsive Design Specifications
- Breakpoint strategy for each component
- Touch target requirements (44px minimum)
- Layout adaptations for different screen sizes
- Specific Tailwind responsive classes to apply

### Suspense + Skeleton Implementation Plan
For each component with dynamic data:
```markdown
#### ComponentName
- **Loading Trigger**: [What causes loading state]
- **Skeleton Design**: [Description of loading placeholder]
- **Suspense Boundary**: [Where to place Suspense wrapper]
- **Fallback Strategy**: [Error and loading handling]
```

### Accessibility Compliance Plan
- WCAG 2.1 AA requirements for each component
- ARIA labels and roles needed
- Keyboard navigation improvements
- Screen reader considerations
- Color contrast validations

## Implementation Roadmap

### Priority Order
1. **Phase 1 Components**: [List components to refactor first]
   - Justification for priority
   - Dependencies that must be completed first

2. **Phase 2 Components**: [List components to refactor second]
   - Dependencies on Phase 1 components
   - Complexity considerations

3. **Phase 3 Components**: [List remaining components]
   - Final integration and polish
   - Testing and validation

### Dependencies and Migration Strategy
- Component dependency graph
- Order of operations to minimize breaking changes
- Shared component extraction plan
- Import/export restructuring requirements

## Quality Validation Checkpoints

### Design Requirements
- [ ] All components use ShadCN semantic colors exclusively
- [ ] Mobile-first responsive design implemented
- [ ] Suspense + Skeleton pattern applied to all dynamic data
- [ ] Component modularity achieved (files < 150 lines)
- [ ] Accessibility standards met (WCAG 2.1 AA)

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes
- [ ] No hardcoded Tailwind colors used
- [ ] Proper import/export structure maintained
- [ ] Server actions extracted to separate files
- [ ] Loading states prevent layout shifts

## Context for Technical Architecture

### Areas Requiring Technical Planning
- Complex component dependencies that need architectural review
- Server action extraction that requires careful planning
- Performance optimization opportunities
- Testing strategy requirements

### Handoff Notes for System-Architect Agent
- Specific technical challenges identified
- Components requiring special migration attention
- Performance considerations for architecture planning
- Risk areas that need mitigation strategies

---

**Next Steps**: This design specification should be used by the System-Architect agent to create detailed technical architecture plans, followed by implementation by the main agent.
